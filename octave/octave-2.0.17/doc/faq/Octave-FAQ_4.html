<P>
The Octave distribution includes a 220+ page manual that is also
distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL.

</P>
<P>
The Octave manual is intended to be a complete reference for Octave, but
it is not a finished document.  If you have problems using it, or find
that some topic is not adequately explained, indexed, or
cross-referenced, please send a bug report to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

</P>
<P>
Because the Octave manual is written using Texinfo, the complete text of
the Octave manual is also available on line using the GNU Info system
via the GNU Emacs, info, or xinfo programs, or by using the <SAMP>`help -i'</SAMP> 
command to start the GNU info browser directly from the Octave prompt.

</P>
<P>
It is also possible to use your favorite WWW browser to read the Octave
manual by converting the Texinfo source to HTML using the
<CODE>texi2html</CODE> program.
