"I wrote some code for MATLAB, and I want to get it running under
Octave.  Is there anything I should watch out for?"

</P>
<P>
The differences between Octave and MATLAB typically fall into one of
three categories:

</P>

<OL>
<LI>

Irrelevant.

<LI>

Known differences, perhaps configurable with a user preference variable.

<LI>

Unknown differences.
</OL>

<P>
The first category, irrelevant differences, do not affect computations
and most likely do not affect the execution of function files.

</P>
<P>
The differences of the second category are usually because the authors
of Octave decided on a better (subjective) implementation that the way
MATLAB does it, and so introduced "user preference variables" so that
you can customize Octave's behavior to be either MATLAB-compatible or
to use Octave's new features.  To make Octave more MATLAB-compatible,
put the following statements in your <TT>`~/.octaverc'</TT> file, or use the
command line option <SAMP>`--traditional'</SAMP>, which implies all of these
settings.  Note that this list may not be complete, because some new
variables may have been introduced since this document was last updated.

<P>
Some other known differences are:

</P>

<UL>
<LI>

The Octave plotting functions are mostly compatible with the ones from
MATLAB 3.x, but not from MATLAB 4.x.
</UL>

<P>
The third category of differences is (hopefully) shrinking.  If you find
a difference between Octave behavior and MATLAB, then you should send a
description of this difference (with code illustrating the difference,
if possible) to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
