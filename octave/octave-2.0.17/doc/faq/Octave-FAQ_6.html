Octave requires approximately 125MB of disk storage to unpack and
compile from source (significantly less if you don't compile with
debugging symbols or create shared libraries).  Once installed, Octave
requires approximately 65MB of disk space (again, considerably less if
you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do not
include debugging symbols).

To compile Octave, you will need a recent version of GNU Make.  You
will also need g++ 2.7.2 or later.  Version 2.8.0 or egcs 1.0.x should
work.  Later versions may work, but C++ is still evolving, so don't be
too surprised if you run into some trouble.

</P>
<P>
It is no longer necessary to have libg++, but you do need to have the
GNU implementation of libstdc++.  If you are using g++ 2.7.2,
libstdc++ is distributed along with libg++, but for later versions,
libstdc++ is distributed separately.  For egcs, libstdc++ is included
with the compiler distribution.

</P>
<P>
&#60;em&#62;You must have gnu make to compile octave&#60;/em&#62;.  Octave's Makefiles
use features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of make.
GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.

<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="Octave-FAQ_toc.html#TOC20">Can I compile Octave with another C++ compiler?</A></H2>

<P>
Currently, Octave can only be compiled with the GNU C++ compiler.  It
would be nice to make it possible to compile Octave with other C++
compilers, but the maintainers do not have sufficient time to devote to
this.  If you are interested in working to make Octave portable to other
compilers, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
