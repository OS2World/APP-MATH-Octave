<H2><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="Octave-FAQ_toc.html#TOC15">How do I get a copy of Octave for Unix?</A></H2>

<P>
You can get Octave from a friend who has a copy, by anonymous FTP, or by
ordering a tape or CD-ROM from the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

</P>

</P>
<P>
Octave was not developed by the FSF, but the FSF does distribute Octave,
and the developers of Octave support the efforts of the FSF by
encouraging users of Octave to order Octave on CD-ROM directly from
the FSF.

</P>
<P>
The FSF is a nonprofit organization that distributes software and
manuals to raise funds for more GNU development.  Buying a CD-ROM from
the FSF contributes directly to paying staff to develop GNU software.
CD-ROMs cost $240 if an organization is buying, or $60 if an individual
is buying.

<P>
For more information about ordering from the FSF, contact
gnu@gnu.org, phone (617) 542-5942 or anonymous ftp the file
<TT>`/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/ORDERS'</TT> from ftp.gnu.org.

If you are on the Internet, you can copy the latest distribution
version of Octave from the file <TT>`/pub/octave/octave-M.N.tar.gz'</TT>, on
the host <TT>`ftp.che.wisc.edu'</TT>.  This tar file has been compressed
with GNU gzip, so be sure to use binary mode for the transfer.  <SAMP>`M'</SAMP>
and <SAMP>`N'</SAMP> stand for version numbers; look at a listing of the
directory through ftp to see what version is available.  After you
unpack the distribution, be sure to look at the files <TT>`README'</TT> and
<TT>`INSTALL'</TT>.

</P>
<P>
Binaries for several popular systems are also available.  If you would
like help out by making binaries available for other systems, please
contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

</P>
<P>
A list of user-visible changes since the last release is available in
the file <TT>`NEWS'</TT>.  The file <TT>`ChangeLog'</TT> in the source
distribution contains a more detailed record of changes made since the
last release.

Octave currently runs on Unix-like systems, OS/2, and Windows NT/95
(using the gnu-win32 tools from Cygnus Support).  It should be possible
to make Octave work on other systems as well.  If you are interested in
porting Octave to other systems, please contact
bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.
