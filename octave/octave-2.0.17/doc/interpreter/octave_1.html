<P>
Octave was originally intended to be companion software for an
undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor design being written by
James B. Rawlings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and John
G. Ekerdt of the University of Texas.

</P>
<P>
Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware' package
with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our initial goals
were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create something that
would enable students to solve realistic problems, and that they could
use for many things other than chemical reactor design problems.

</P>
<P>
There are those who would say that we should be teaching the students
Fortran instead, because that is the computer language of engineering,
but every time we have tried that, the students have spent far too much
time trying to figure out why their Fortran code crashes and not enough
time learning about chemical engineering.  With Octave, most students
pick up the basics quickly, and are using it confidently in just a few
hours.

</P>
<P>
Although it was originally intended to be used to teach reactor design,
it has been used in several other undergraduate and graduate
courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of
Texas, and the math department at the University of Texas has been using
it for teaching differential equations and linear algebra as well.  If
you find it useful, please let us know.  We are always interested to
find out how Octave is being used in other places.

</P>
<P>
Virtually everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with
music, but it is actually the name of a former professor of mine who
wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering, and who was
also well known for his ability to do quick `back of the envelope'
calculations.  We hope that this software will make it possible for many
people to do more ambitious computations just as easily.

</P>
<P>
Everyone is encouraged to share this software with others under the
terms of the GNU General Public License (see section <A HREF="octave_36.html#SEC202">GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</A>) as described
at the beginning of this manual.  You are also encouraged to help make
Octave more useful by writing and contributing additional functions for
it, and by reporting any problems you may have.

Many people have already contributed to Octave's development.  In
addition to John W. Eaton, the following people have helped write parts
of Octave or helped out in various other ways.

<LI>

Thomas Baier @email{baier@ci.tuwien.ac.at} wrote the original versions

<CODE>async_system</CODE>.

Karl Berry @email{karl@cs.umb.edu} wrote the <CODE>kpathsea</CODE> library
that allows Octave to recursively search directory paths for function
and script files.

<LI>

Georg Beyerle @email{gbeyerle@awi-potsdam.de} contributed code to save
values in MATLAB's <TT>`.mat'</TT>-file format, and has provided many
useful bug reports and suggestions.

<LI>

John Campbell @email{jcc@bevo.che.wisc.edu} wrote most of the file and
C-style input and output functions.

<LI>

Brian Fox @email{bfox@gnu.ai.mit.edu} wrote the <CODE>readline</CODE> library
used for command history editing, and the portion of this manual that
documents it.

<LI>

Klaus Gebhardt @email{gebhardt@crunch.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de}
ported Octave to OS/2.

<LI>

A. Scottedward Hodel @email{A.S.Hodel@eng.auburn.edu} contributed a number
of functions including <CODE>expm</CODE>, <CODE>qzval</CODE>, <CODE>qzhess</CODE>,
<CODE>syl</CODE>, <CODE>lyap</CODE>, and <CODE>balance</CODE>.

<CODE>lcd</CODE>, <CODE>kurtosis</CODE>, <CODE>null</CODE>, <CODE>orth</CODE>, <CODE>poly</CODE>,
<CODE>polyfit</CODE>, <CODE>roots</CODE>, and <CODE>skewness</CODE> functions, supplied
documentation for these and numerous other functions, rewrote the Emacs
mode for editing Octave code and provided its documentation, and has
helped tremendously with testing.  He has also been a constant source of
new ideas for improving Octave.

<LI>

Phil Johnson @email{johnsonp@nicco.sscnet.ucla.edu} has helped to make
Linux releases available.

<LI>

Friedrich Leisch @email{leisch@ci.tuwien.ac.at} provided the
<CODE>mahalanobis</CODE> function.

<LI>

Ken Neighbors @email{wkn@leland.stanford.edu} has provided many useful
bug reports and comments on MATLAB compatibility.

<LI>

Rick Niles @email{niles@axp745.gsfc.nasa.gov} rewrote Octave's plotting
functions to add line styles and the ability to specify an unlimited
number of lines in a single call.  He also continues to track down odd
incompatibilities and bugs.

<LI>

Mark Odegard @email{meo@sugarland.unocal.com} provided the initial
implementation of <CODE>fread</CODE>, <CODE>fwrite</CODE>, <CODE>feof</CODE>, and
<CODE>ferror</CODE>.

<H2><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="octave_toc.html#TOC3">How You Can Contribute to Octave</A></H2>
<P>
<A NAME="IDX4"></A>
<A NAME="IDX5"></A>

</P>
<P>
There are a number of ways that you can contribute to help make Octave a
better system.  Perhaps the most important way to contribute is to write
high-quality code for solving new problems, and to make your code freely
available for others to use.

</P>
<P>
If you find Octave useful, consider providing additional funding to
continue its development.  Even a modest amount of additional funding
could make a significant difference in the amount of time that is
available for development and support.

</P>
<P>
If you cannot provide funding or contribute code, you can still help
make Octave better and more reliable by reporting any bugs you find and
by offering suggestions for ways to improve Octave.  See section <A HREF="octave_32.html#SEC181">Known Causes of Trouble</A>, for
tips on how to write useful bug reports.

</P>
