If you are new to Octave, I recommend that you try these examples to
begin learning Octave by using it.  Lines marked with <b>octave:13></b>
are lines you type, ending each with a carriage return.  Octave will
respond with an answer, or by displaying a graph.<p>

<ol>
<li> <b>Creating a Matrix</b><hr>

To create a new matrix and store it in a variable so that it you can
refer to it later, type the command<p>
<pre>octave:1> a = [ 1, 1, 2; 3, 5, 8; 13, 21, 34 ]</pre><p>
Octave will respond by printing the matrix in neatly aligned columns.
Ending a command with a semicolon tells Octave to not print the result
of a command.  For example<p>
<pre>octave:2> b = rand (3, 2);</pre><p>
will create a 3 row, 2 column matrix with each element set to a random
value between zero and one.<p>
To display the value of any variable, simply type the name of the
variable.  For example, to display the value stored in the matrix
<b>b</b>, type the command<p>
<pre>octave:3> b</pre><p>
<center><img src="octave7.gif" align=middle></center><hr><p>

<li><b>Matrix Arithmetic</b><hr>

Octave has a convenient operator notation for performing matrix
arithmetic.  For example, to multiply the matrix <b>a</b> by a scalar
value, type the command<p>
<pre>octave:4> 2 * a</pre><p>
To multiply the two matrices <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, type the command<p>
<pre>octave:5> a * b</pre><p>
To form the matrix product <b>a' * a</b>, type the command<p>
<pre>octave:6> a' * a</pre><p>
<center><img src="octave8.gif" align=middle></center><hr><p>

<li><b>Solving Linear Equations</b><hr>

To solve the set of linear equations <b>Ax = b</b>,
use the left division operator, <b>\</b>:<p>
<center><img src="octave9.gif" align=middle></center><p>
This is conceptually equivalent to <b>inv(A) * b</b>,
but avoids computing the inverse of a matrix directly.
If the coefficient matrix is singular, Octave will print a warning
message and compute a minimum norm solution.<hr><p>

<li><b>Integrating Differential Equations</b><hr>

Octave has built-in functions for solving nonlinear differential
equations of the form<p>
<pre>dx / dt = f (x, t)</pre><p>
 with the initial condition<p>
<pre>x(t = t0) = x0</pre><p>
For Octave to integrate equations of this form, you must first provide a
definition of the function <b>f(x,t)</b>.<p>
This is straightforward, and may be accomplished by entering the
function body directly on the command line.  For example, the following
commands define the right hand side function for an interesting pair of
nonlinear differential equations.  Note that while you are entering a
function, Octave responds with a different prompt, to indicate that it
is waiting for you to complete your input.<p>
<pre>
octave:8> function xdot = f (x, t)
>
>  r = 0.25;
>  k = 1.4;
>  a = 1.5;
>  b = 0.16;
>  c = 0.9;
>  d = 0.8;
>
>  xdot(1) = r*x(1)*(1 - x(1)/k) - a*x(1)*x(2)/(1 + b*x(1));
>  xdot(2) = c*a*x(1)*x(2)/(1 + b*x(1)) - d*x(2);
>
> endfunction
</pre><p>

Given the initial condition<p>
<pre>x0 = [1; 2];</pre><p>
and the set of output times as a column vector (note that the first
output time corresponds to the initial condition given above)<p>
<pre>t = linspace (0, 50, 200)';</pre><p>
it is easy to integrate the set of differential equations:<p>
<pre>x = lsode ("f", x0, t);</pre><p>
The function <b>lsode</b> uses the Livermore Solver for Ordinary
Differential Equations, described in A. C. Hindmarsh, <b>ODEPACK, a
Systematized Collection of ODE Solvers</b>, in: Scientific Computing, R. S.
Stepleman et al. (Eds.), North-Holland, Amsterdam, 1983, pages 55--64.

<li><b>Producing Graphical Output</b><hr>

To display the solution of the previous example graphically, use the
command<p>
<pre>plot (t, x)</pre><p>

<table align=center CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

<td align=center><a href="octave3.html"><img src=octave3s.gif></a></td>
<td align=left valign=top>

<li>Integrating the above differential equation.
<li>The plot command will start Gnuplot, which will display
the plot in a seperate window.
<li>The Gnuplot window.
</ol>
<p>

on the picture.<p>
If you are using the X Window System, Octave will automatically create
a separate window to display the plot.  If you are using a terminal that
supports some other graphics commands, you will need to tell Octave what
kind of terminal you have.  Type the command<p>
<pre>gset term</pre><p>
to see a list of the supported terminal types.  Octave uses
<b>gnuplot</b> to display graphics, and can display graphics on any
terminal that is supported by <b>gnuplot</b>.
</td>
</table><p>

To capture the output of the plot command in a file rather than sending
the output directly to your terminal, you can use a set of commands like
this<p>
<pre>
gset term postscript
gset output "foo.ps"
replot
</pre><p>
This will work for other types of output devices as well.  Octave's
<b>gset</b> command is really just piped to the <b>gnuplot</b>
subprocess, so that once you have a plot on the screen that you like,
you should be able to do something like this to create an output file
suitable for your graphics printer.<p>

Or, you can eliminate the intermediate file by using commands like this<p>
<pre>
gset term postscript
gset output "|lpr -Pname_of_your_graphics_printer"
replot
</pre><hr><p>

<li><b>Editing What You Have Typed</b><hr>

At the Octave prompt, you can recall, edit, and reissue previous
commands using Emacs- or vi-style editing commands.  The default
keybindings use Emacs-style commands.  For example, to recall the
previous command, type <b>Control-P</b> (usually written <b>C-p</b> for
short).  <b>C-p</b> gets  its name from the fact that you type it by
holding down the <b>CTRL</b> key and then pressing <b>p</b>.  Doing this
will normally bring back the previous line of input.  <b>C-n</b> will
bring up the next line of input, <b>C-b</b> will move the cursor backward
on the line, <b>C-f</b> will move the cursor forward on the line, etc.<hr><p>

<li><b>Getting Help</b><hr>

Octave has an extensive help facility.  The same documentation that is
available in printed form is also available from the Octave prompt,
because both forms of the documentation are created from the same input
file.

In order to get good help you first need to know the name of the command
that you want to use.  This name of the function may not always be
obvious, but a good place to start is to just type <b>help</b>.
This will show you all the operators, reserved words, functions,
built-in variables, and function files.  You can then get more
help on anything that is listed by simply including the name as an
argument to help.  For example,<p>
<pre>help plot</pre><p>
will display the help text for the <b>plot</b> function.

Octave sends output that is too long to fit on one screen through a
pager like <b>less</b> or <b>more</b>.  Type a carriage return to
advance one line, a space character to advance one page, and </b>q</b> to
exit the pager.<hr><p>

<li><b>Help via Info</b><hr>

<table align=center CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>

<td align=center><a href="octave4.html"><img src=octave4s.gif></a></td>
<td align=left valign=top>
The part of Octave's help facility that allows you to read the complete
text of the printed manual from within Octave uses a program called
Info.  When you invoke Info you will be put into a menu driven program
that contains the entire Octave manual.<p>
<ol>
<li>If you type <b>help -i asi</b> Octave will open a second
buffer and start the Emacs info browser.

<li><b>Function and Script files</b><hr>

Except for simple one-shot programs, it is not practical to have to
define all the functions you need each time you need them.  Instead, you
will normally want to save them in a file so that you can easily edit
them, and save them for use at a later time.<p>

<table align=center CELLSPACING=2 CELLPADDING=2>
<tr>
<td align=center><a href="octave2.html"><img src=octave2s.gif></a></td>
<td align=left valign=top>
Octave does not require you to load function definitions from files
before using them.  You simply need to put the function definitions in a
place where Octave can find them.<p>
When Octave encounters an identifier that is undefined, it first looks
for variables or functions that are already compiled and currently
listed in its symbol table.  If it fails to find a definition there, it
searches the list of directories specified by the built-in variable
<b>LOADPATH</b> for files ending in <b>.m</b> that have the same base
name as the undefined identifier (The <b>.m</b> suffix was
chosen for compatibility with <b>Matlab</b>).  Once Octave finds a file
with a name that matches, the contents of the file are read.  If it
defines a <b>single</b> function, it is compiled and executed.<p>

</table>

A script file is a file containing (almost) any sequence of Octave
commands.  It is read and evaluated just as if you had typed each
command at the Octave prompt, and provides a convenient way to perform a
sequence of commands that do not logically belong inside a function.<p>

Unlike a function file, a script file must <b>not</b> begin with the
keyword <b>function</b>.  If it does, Octave will assume that it is a
function file, and that it defines a single function that should be
evaluated as soon as it is defined.<p>

A script file also differs from a function file in that the variables
named in a script file are not local variables, but are in the same
scope as the other variables that are visible on the command line.<p>

Even though a script file may not begin with the <b>function</b>
keyword, it is possible to define more than one function in a single
script file and load (but not execute) all of them at once.  To do 
this, the first token in the file (ignoring comments and other white
space) must be something other than <b>function</b>.<p>
