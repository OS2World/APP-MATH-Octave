how to write your own executable Octave programs.

On most systems, the way to invoke Octave is with the shell command
<b>octave</b>.  Octave displays an initial message and then a prompt
indicating it is ready to accept input.  You can begin typing Octave
commands immediately afterward.<p>

If you get into trouble, you can usually interrupt Octave by typing
<b>Control-C</b> (usually written <b>C-c</b> for short).  <b>C-c</b> gets
its name from the fact that you type it by holding down the <b>CTRL</b>
key and then pressing <b>c</b>.  Doing this will normally return you to
Octave's prompt.<p>

To exit Octave, type <b>quit</b>, <b>exit</b> or <b>Control-D</b>
at the Octave prompt. On systems that support job control, you can
suspend Octave by sending it a SIGTSTP signal, usually by typing
<b>C-z</b>.<p>

Once you have learned Octave, you may want to write self-contained
Octave scripts, using the <b>#!</b> script mechanism.  You can do this
on GNU systems and on many Unix systems (The <b>#!</b>
mechanism works on Unix systems derived from Berkeley Unix, System V
Release 4, and some System V Release 3 systems. On <b>OS/2</b> you must
replace <b>#!</b> by <b>extproc</b>). For example, you could create a text
file named <b>hello.cmd</b>, containing the following lines:<p>
<pre>
extproc octave -qf
# a sample Octave program
printf ("Hello, world!\n");
</pre><p>
After making this file executable (with the <b>chmod</b> command, if
necessary), you can simply type:<p>
<pre>hello</pre><p>
at the shell, and the system will arrange to run Octave
as if you had typed:<p>
<pre>octave -qf hello.cmd</pre><p>
The line beginning with <b>extproc</b> lists the full file name of an
interpreter to be run, and an optional initial command line argument to
pass to that interpreter.  The operating system then runs the interpreter
with the given argument and the full argument list of the executed program.
The first argument in the list is the full file name of the Octave program.
The rest of the argument list will either be options to Octave, or data
files, or both.  The <b>-qf</b> option is usually specified in
stand-alone Octave programs to prevent them from printing the normal
startup message, and to keep them from behaving differently depending on
the contents of a particular user's <b>~/.octaverc</b> file.
Self-contained Octave scripts are useful when you want to write a
program which users can invoke without knowing that the program is
written in the Octave language.<p>
