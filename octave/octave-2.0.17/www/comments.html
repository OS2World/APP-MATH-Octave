A <b>comment</b> is some text that is included in a program for the sake
of human readers, and that is not really part of the program.  Comments
can explain what the program does, and how it works.  Nearly all
programming languages have provisions for comments, because programs are
typically hard to understand without them.

In the Octave language, a comment starts with either the sharp sign
character, <b>#</b>, or the percent symbol <b>%</b> and continues to the
end of the line.  The Octave interpreter ignores the rest of a
line following a sharp sign or percent symbol.  For example, we could
have put the following into the function <b>f</b>:<p>
<pre>
function xdot = f (x, t)

# usage: f (x, t)
#
# This function defines the right-hand-side functions for a set of
# nonlinear differential equations.

r = 0.25

and so on ...

endfunction
</pre><p>

The <b>help</b> command is able to find the first block
of comments in a function (even those that are composed directly on the
command line).  This means that users of Octave can use the same
commands to get help for built-in functions, and for functions that you
have defined.  For example, after defining the function <b>f</b> above,
the command<p>
<pre>help f</pre><p>
produces the output<p>
<pre>
usage: f (x, t)

This function defines the right-hand-side functions for a set of
nonlinear differential equations.
</pre><p>

Although it is possible to put comment lines into keyboard-composed
throw-away Octave programs, it usually isn't very useful, because the
purpose of a comment is to help you or another person understand the
program at a later time.<p>
