There are two classes of errors that Octave produces when it encounters
input that it is unable to understand, or when it is unable to perform
an action.<p>

A <b>parse error</b> occurs if Octave cannot understand something you
have typed.  For example, if you misspell a keyword:<p>

For most parse errors, Octave uses a caret (<b>^</b>) to mark the point
on the line where it was unable to make sense of your input.  In this
case, Octave generated an error message because the keyword
<b>function</b> was misspelled.  Instead of seeing <b>function f</b>,
Octave saw two consecutive variable names, which is invalid in this
context.  It marked the error at the <b>y</b> because the first name by
itself was accepted as valid input.<p>

Another class of error message occurs occurs at evaluation time.  These
errors are called <b>run-time errors</b>, or sometimes
evaluation errors</b> because they occur when your program is being
<b>run</b>, or <b>evaluated</b>.  For example, if after correcting the
mistake in the previous function definition, you type<p>

This error message has several parts, and gives you quite a bit of
information to help you locate the source of the error.  The messages
are generated from the point of the innermost error, and provide a
traceback of enclosing expressions and function calls.<p>

In the example above, the first line indicates that a variable named
<b>x</b> was found to be undefined near line 1 and column 24 of some
function or expression.  For errors occurring within functions, lines
from the beginning of the file containing the function definition.  For
errors occurring at the top level, the line number indicates the input
line number, which is usually displayed in the prompt string.<p>

The second and third lines in the example indicate that the error
occurred within an assignment expression, and the last line of the error
message indicates that the error occurred within the function <b>f</b>.
If the function <b>f</b> had been called from another function, for
example, <b>g</b>, the list of errors would have ended with one more
line:<p>
<pre>error: called from `g'</pre><p>
These lists of function calls usually make it fairly easy to trace the
path your program took before the error occurred, and to correct the
error before trying again.<p>
